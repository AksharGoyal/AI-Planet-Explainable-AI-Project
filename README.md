# AI Planet Explainable AI Project
## Project as part of Explainable AI bootcamp

As part of the [Explainable AI](https://aiplanet.com/bootcamp/certificate/verify/f9cd748b-48b8-41a5-8a6d-bef0a26ae7b4) bootcamp organized by AI planet formerly DPhi, I had to work on a project that used Random Forest and SHAP that helped in identifying the factors that classified breast cancer as benign or malignant.

I had never heard of SHAP before this bootcamp but I am glad I got to know about it through this. I was always curious to know how we could infer which variables affected the dependent variable and to what extent. SHAP is a great tool in understanding the impact of every variable in deciding the class to put the data point in.
